    <h3>History</h3>
	<div class="box">
		<p>1859: Charles Darwin publishes "On the Origin of Species," introducing the theory of evolution by natural selection.</p>
        <p>1871: Darwin publishes "The Descent of Man," in which he applies evolutionary theory to human origins and behavior.</p>
        <p>1964: William Hamilton introduces the concept of inclusive fitness, laying the groundwork for understanding altruism and social behavior from an evolutionary perspective.</p>
        <p>1975: E.O. Wilson publishes "Sociobiology: The New Synthesis," proposing that social behavior, including human behavior, can be explained by evolutionary principles.</p>
        <p>1982: Richard Dawkins publishes "The Extended Phenotype," further elaborating on the concepts of gene-centered evolution and the role of genes in behavior.</p>
        <p>1986: John Tooby and Leda Cosmides publish influential papers outlining the foundations of evolutionary psychology and its emphasis on domain-specific cognitive mechanisms.</p>
        <p>1992: David Buss publishes "The Evolution of Desire," a comprehensive overview of evolutionary psychology applied to human mating behavior.</p>
        <p>1997: Steven Pinker publishes "How the Mind Works," popularizing evolutionary psychology and its implications for understanding the human mind.</p>
        <p>2005: Martin Daly and Margo Wilson publish "The Truth About Cinderella," applying evolutionary psychology to understanding patterns of step-parental investment and family dynamics.</p>
        <p>2011: The journal "Evolutionary Psychology" is established, providing a platform for research in the field.</p>
        <p>2020s: Evolutionary psychology continues to evolve, with ongoing research exploring new applications and controversies in the field.</p>

    <div class="cd">
        <p>Charles Darwin (born February 12, 1809, Shrewsbury, Shropshire, England—died April 19, 1882, Downe, Kent) was an English naturalist whose scientific theory of evolution by natural selection became the foundation of modern evolutionary studies. An affable country gentleman, Darwin at first shocked religious Victorian society by suggesting that animals and humans shared a common ancestry. However, his nonreligious biology appealed to the rising class of professional scientists, and by the time of his death evolutionary imagery had spread through all of science, literature, and politics. Darwin, himself an agnostic, was accorded the ultimate British accolade of burial in Westminster Abbey, London.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Sir William Rowan Hamilton (born August 3/4, 1805, Dublin, Ireland—died September 2, 1865, Dublin) was an Irish mathematician who contributed to the development of optics, dynamics, and algebra—in particular, discovering the algebra of quaternions. His work proved significant for the development of quantum mechanics.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Richard Dawkins (born March 26, 1941, Nairobi, Kenya) is a British evolutionary biologist, ethologist, and popular-science writer who emphasized the gene as the driving force of evolution and generated significant controversy with his enthusiastic advocacy of atheism.</p>
        <p>Tooby and Cosmides are joint editors of The Adapted Mind: Evolutionary Psychology and the Generation of Culture, a book that helped to widely launch Evolutionary Psychology as a widely influential field of study. In association with their roles they have produced a Primer that explicitly outlines their view of the role and direction of Evolutionary Psychology. According to the Primer researches should aspire to more fully discover things about the human mind and to understand its design. The mind is seen as being:- "a set of information-processing machines that were designed by natural selection to solve adaptive problems faced by our hunter-gatherer ancestors".</p>
        <p>David Buss is one of the founders of the field of evolutionary psychology. His primary research focus is on strategies of human mating. He is most well-known for his studies on mate selection, tactics of mate attraction, infidelity, tactics of mate retention, tactics of mate poaching, and the mating emotions of jealousy, lust, and love. He has taught at Berkeley, Harvard University, the University of Michigan, and the University of Texas.</p>
        <p>Steven Pinker is an experimental cognitive psychologist and a popular writer on language, mind, and human nature. A native of Montreal, he earned his bachelor’s degree at McGill University in 1976, his PhD from Harvard in 1979, and taught at Harvard, Stanford, and MIT before returning to Harvard in 2003.</p>
        <p>Martin Daly and Margo Wilson apply contemporary evolutionary theory to analysis of human motives and perceptions of self-interest, considering where and why individual interests conflict, using well-documented murder cases. This book attempts to understand normal social motives in murder as products of the process of evolution by natural selection.</p>
